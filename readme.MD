# TaskFlow üöÄ

A collaborative, real-time project management tool inspired by Jira and Trello. Built with the MERN/PERN stack, it provides a seamless experience for teams to manage workspaces, projects, and tasks on a Kanban-style board.

---

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Authentication & User Roles**: Secure sign-up and login with JWT. Role-based access control (**Admin** and **Member**).
-   **Workspace Management**: Users can create and manage their own workspaces, similar to organizations in other tools.
-   **Project Organization**: Create multiple projects within each workspace to keep your work segmented.
-   **CRUD for Tasks**: Full create, read, update, and delete functionality for tasks.
-   **Interactive Kanban Board**: A drag-and-drop interface to move tasks between statuses (**To Do**, **In Progress**, **Done**).
-   **Real-Time Collaboration**: Live updates across all connected clients using **Socket.IO**. When one user moves a task, everyone sees it instantly.
-   **Task Commenting**: Discuss task details with your team right where the work is happening.
-   **Notifications**: Get notified when you're assigned a task or when there's a new comment.
-   **Productivity Tools**: Assign **due dates** and **priorities** (Low, Medium, High) to tasks.
-   **Labels & Tagging**: Categorize tasks with labels like `Bug`, `Frontend`, or `Backend` for easy filtering.

-   npm, pnpm, or yarn
-   PostgreSQL instance

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Install backend dependencies:**
    ```sh
    cd server
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```sh

    npm install
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    -   In the `server` directory, create a `.env` file and add the following variables. See `.env.example` for a template.
    ```env
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE"
    JWT_SECRET="your_super_secret_key"
    ```

5.  **Run database migrations:**
